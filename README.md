# Distributed Systems - University Assignment

This repository contains a university assignment for the Distributed Systems course. The main objective of the project is to implement and explore communication protocols, including:

- **Socket Programming (TCP/UDP)**
- **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**
- **HTTP-based communication**

The activities aim to provide hands-on experience with key concepts in distributed computing, such as network communication, client-server architecture, and protocol implementation.
